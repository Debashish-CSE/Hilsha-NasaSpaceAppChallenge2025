Just hilsha

- For now the web app in its static version with using any datasets provided in the the challenge
- opestreetmap api to count healthcare facilities and other buildings
- For population i just used math where avarage growth rate is 2.5% or youcan say 2500 for population
- For production we have to or should use worldpop datasets which I already included in the data folder. as long as we are working with api's we dont need a seperate backend folder.

Base version live in vercel. Also I defenitely took help of some "tools" but not too much becuase there is already enoguh components free on the internet.
